####If you want download this to catch data from https://book.douban.com/, I am pity. 
####And you must be a Chinese, I am very sorry about my poor Endlish to make you confuse. 

####There are some difficulty things you should overcome. 
####First,you should install sql server. The developer choose this database by accident. He only know this database.  

####Second: After you download code, choose solution: Dyllan.sln 
####Of course you may can't build this, so do I. Solve it all by yourself. There is nothing I can do for you. God blass you. 

####Third: If you find some code is useful, it is great for me to see that because I never thought this solution is useful for you.
